# Talk

Create, audit, or compile presentations (Beamer or Quarto RevealJS).

**Input:** `$ARGUMENTS` — mode and format/path.

---

## Modes

### `/talk create [format]` — Create Beamer Talk
### `/talk create [format] --quarto` — Create Quarto RevealJS Talk

Generate a presentation from the paper.

**Agents:** Storyteller (creator) → storyteller-critic (reviewer)

#### Format Constraints

| Format | Slides | Duration | Content Scope |
|--------|--------|----------|---------------|
| job-market | 40-50 | 45-60 min | Full story, all results, mechanism, robustness |
| seminar | 25-35 | 30-45 min | Motivation, main result, 2 robustness, conclusion |
| short | 10-15 | 15 min | Question, method, key result, implication |
| lightning | 3-5 | 5 min | Hook, one result, so-what |

#### Workflow

**Step 1: Parse Arguments**

- **Format** (required): `job-market` | `seminar` | `short` | `lightning`
- **Paper path** (optional): defaults to Overleaf `Paper/main.tex` (read from CLAUDE.md Overleaf path)
- **Engine**: Beamer (default) or Quarto RevealJS (`--quarto`)
- If no format specified, ask the user.

**Step 2: Dispatch Storyteller**

Read the paper and extract: research question, identification strategy, main result, secondary results, robustness checks, key figures/tables, institutional background. Design narrative arc for the chosen format. Build the slide file with shared preamble if available.

The Storyteller follows these design principles:
- **One idea per slide** — never cram two concepts onto one frame
- **Figures over tables; tables in backup** — audiences absorb figures instantly; regression tables belong in backup slides where referees can inspect them during Q&A
- **Build tension** — motivation → question → method → findings → implications
- **Transition slides between major sections** — signal where the talk is going
- **All claims must appear in the paper** — the paper is the single source of truth; never add results or claims that are not in the manuscript

Compile with XeLaTeX (Beamer) or `quarto render` (Quarto).

Save to Overleaf `Slides/[name]/[name].tex` (Beamer) or `paper/quarto/[name].qmd` (Quarto). Each talk gets its own folder under Slides/ with a unique descriptive name (e.g., `march_2026_ucdavis.tex`, `aea_2027_poster.tex`). Ask the user for the name if not provided.

**Step 3: Dispatch Storyteller-Critic**

After the Storyteller returns, dispatch the storyteller-critic to review across 5 categories:

| Category | What It Checks |
|----------|---------------|
| **Narrative flow** | Does the story build properly? Is there a clear arc from motivation through results to implications? Are transitions smooth? |
| **Visual quality** | Text overflow, font readability (>= 10pt), figure sizing, consistent formatting, overfull hbox warnings |
| **Content fidelity** | Every claim traceable to the paper — no orphan results, no unsupported statements |
| **Scope for format** | Right amount of content for the duration — not cramming a seminar into a lightning talk, not padding a short talk to seminar length |
| **Compilation** | Does it compile cleanly without errors or warnings? |

Score as advisory (non-blocking). Save report to `quality_reports/[format]_talk_review.md`.

**Step 4: Fix Critical Issues**

If the storyteller-critic finds Critical issues (compilation failures, content not in paper):
1. Re-dispatch Storyteller with specific fixes (max 3 rounds per three-strikes rule)
2. Re-run storyteller-critic to verify

**Step 5: Present Results**

Report to the user:
1. Generated file path
2. Slide count and format compliance
3. Storyteller-critic score (advisory, non-blocking)
4. TODO items (missing figures, tables not yet generated)

### `/talk audit [file]` — Visual Audit

Check existing slides for layout issues.

Run visual quality checks:
- Text overflow on any slide
- Font sizes (>= 10pt for projection)
- Table readability
- Figure sizing and labels
- Consistent formatting
- Overfull hbox warnings

---

### `/talk compile [file]` — Compile Talk

3-pass XeLaTeX compilation for Beamer:
```bash
cd [OVERLEAF_PATH]/Slides/[name] && TEXINPUTS=../../Preambles:$TEXINPUTS pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode [name].tex
```

For Quarto:
```bash
cd paper/quarto && quarto render [file]
```

## Principles

- **Paper is authoritative.** Every claim must appear in the paper.
- **Figures over tables.** Audiences absorb figures instantly. Put regression tables in backup slides for Q&A.
- **Less is more.** Especially for short and lightning formats — ruthlessly cut.
- **One idea per slide.** If you need a second point, make a second slide.
- **Audience calibration.** Job market = demonstrate rigor and command of the literature. Seminar = sell the interesting result. Short = method and key finding. Lightning = sell the idea in one breath.
- **Advisory scoring.** Talk scores don't block commits.
- **Worker-critic pairing.** Storyteller creates, storyteller-critic critiques. Never skip the review.
