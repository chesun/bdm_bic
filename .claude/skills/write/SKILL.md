# Write

Draft paper sections or apply humanizer pass by dispatching the **Writer** agent.

**Input:** `$ARGUMENTS` — section name or mode, optionally followed by file path.

---

## Modes

### `/write [section]` — Draft Paper Section
Draft a specific section: `intro`, `design`, `results`, `theory`, `conclusion`, `abstract`, or `full`.

**Agent:** Writer
**Output:** LaTeX section file in paper/sections/

Workflow:

#### 1. Context Gathering

Before drafting, read all available context:
1. Read existing paper draft in `paper/` (if it exists)
2. Read `master_supporting_docs/` for notes, outlines, research specs
3. Read most recent `quality_reports/research_spec_*.md`, `quality_reports/designs/`, or `quality_reports/lit_review_*.md`
4. Read `.claude/references/domain-profile-behavioral.md` for field conventions
5. Read `quality_reports/paper_learnings/theory-writing-learnings.md` for McCloskey/Cochrane/Knuth writing rules
6. Check `bibliography_base.bib` for available citations
7. Scan Overleaf `Tables/` and `Figures/` for generated output
8. Read `quality_reports/results_summary.md` if it exists (from Coder)

#### 2. Section Routing

Based on `$ARGUMENTS`:
- **`full`**: Draft all sections in sequence, pausing between major sections for user feedback
- **`intro`**: Draft introduction (most common request)
- **`theory`**: Draft theoretical framework / model section
- **`design`**: Draft experimental design section (treatments, elicitation, incentives, procedures)
- **`results`**: Draft results from available output
- **`conclusion`**: Draft conclusion
- **`abstract`**: Draft abstract (must have other sections first)
- **No argument**: Ask user which section to draft

#### 3. Dispatch Writer

Dispatch Writer with section standards, notation protocol, and anti-hedging rules. Humanizer pass runs automatically before finalizing. Save to `paper/sections/[section].tex`.

#### 4. Quality Self-Check

Before presenting the draft:
- [ ] Every displayed equation is numbered (`\label{eq:...}`)
- [ ] All `\cite{}` keys exist in `Bibliography_base.bib`
- [ ] Introduction contribution paragraph names specific papers
- [ ] Effect sizes stated with units
- [ ] No banned hedging phrases
- [ ] Notation consistent throughout
- [ ] All tables/figures referenced actually exist in Overleaf `Tables/` or `Figures/`
- [ ] Experimental reporting checklist satisfied (if design or results section)
- [ ] No McCloskey anti-patterns (no "This paper...", no passive voice, no hedging)
- [ ] Math writing follows Knuth rules (formulas separated by words, no symbol-starting sentences)

#### 5. Present to User

Present each section for feedback. Flag items that need attention:
- **TBD items:** Where empirical results are needed but not yet available
- **VERIFY items:** Citations that need user confirmation
- **PLACEHOLDER items:** Effect sizes awaiting final estimates

### `/write humanize [file]` — Humanizer Pass Only
Strip AI writing patterns from existing text without rewriting content.

**Agent:** Writer (humanizer mode)
**Output:** Edited file with AI patterns removed

Strips 24 patterns across 4 categories:
- Structural: forced narrative arcs, artificial progression
- Lexical: "delve,leverage,nuanced,robust"
- Rhetorical: rule-of-three, negative parallelisms, em dash overuse
- Formatting: excessive bullet points, promotional language

## Section Standards

| Section | Length | Key Requirements |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Introduction | 1000-1500 words | First sentence states YOUR contribution (Cochrane). Punchline first, max 3 pages. Never "This paper..." (McCloskey). |
| Theory | 800-1200 words | Main result by page 15 (Board & Meyer-ter-Vehn). Theorems as English takeaways. One model per paper. |
| Design | 800-1200 words | Subject pool (N, demographics, payment), treatments, elicitation with IC justification, procedures, pre-registration reference |
| Results | 800-1500 words | Main spec, non-parametric tests, effect sizes in economic terms, heterogeneity, multiple testing corrections |
| Conclusion | 500-700 words | Restate with effect size, policy, limitations, future |
| Abstract | 100-150 words | Question, method, finding with magnitude, implication |

### Experimental Reporting Checklist (for `design` and `results` sections)
- [ ] N recruited and N analyzed
- [ ] Subject demographics (age, gender, education, experience)
- [ ] Exclusion criteria and counts per criterion
- [ ] Treatment descriptions with exact instructions (or "see Appendix")
- [ ] Payment: show-up fee, average earnings, range, duration
- [ ] Pre-registration: registry, ID, date, link
- [ ] Clustering level and justification

## LaTeX Conventions

- `\citet{}` for textual citations ("Smith (2024) shows...")
- `\citep{}` for parenthetical citations ("...is well documented (Smith, 2024)")
- `booktabs` rules (`\toprule`, `\midrule`, `\bottomrule`) — never `\hline`
- Notation protocol: `Y_{it}`, `D_{it}`, `\gamma_i`, `\delta_t`, `\varepsilon_{it}`

---

## Principles
- **This is the user's paper, not Claude's.** Match their voice and style.
- **Never fabricate results.** Use TBD placeholders.
- **Citations must be verifiable.** Only cite confirmed papers.
- **Humanizer is automatic.** Every draft gets de-AI-ified.
