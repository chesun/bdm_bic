# Adversarial Default

**The principle: burden of proof is on the asserter, not the critic.**

When evaluating any artifact — code, data, experimental design, identification strategy, replication, bibliography — the default assumption is that the artifact has defects. Compliance is a positive claim that requires positive evidence (a grep result, a test output, a diagnostic, a formal proof). "I read it and it looks fine" is not evidence; it is the absence of evidence.

This inverts the prevailing pattern. Without this rule, an agent reviewing inherited code says "no issues found" when no obvious red flags appear. With this rule, the same agent must produce concrete evidence that *each* relevant convention is satisfied — or note that evidence is missing and the claim is unverified.

**Counterbalance — non-bloat:** adversarial-default does not mean re-running every check on every task. A verified artifact stays verified until it changes. Verification results are cached in a project ledger; agents consult the ledger before running a check. See § Verification ledger.

**Three vocabulary cousins** (the principle borrows from each):
- *Engineering — fool-proofing / poka-yoke.* Design for the worst case so that even an inattentive operator can't produce a defect.
- *Security — zero trust.* Never trust by virtue of origin; always verify.
- *Falsifiability.* Claims that can't be falsified are claims you haven't actually checked.

## Inherited-artifact protocol

When working with code, text, data, or design materials that you didn't write *in this session*, the prior is "presumed non-compliant with this project's conventions." Original authors didn't have these conventions; even if they did, drift accumulates. Before any claim of compliance, run the per-domain pre-flight checklist (§ Per-domain checklists) and record results in the verification ledger.

This does not apply to artifacts produced earlier in the same session (you saw them being written; you have direct evidence) — though if substantial time has passed and the file has been further edited externally, treat it as inherited again.

---

## Per-domain checklists

Six domains. Each lists concrete checks with the specific command-or-equivalent that produces evidence. Run them before claiming compliance. Cache results in the ledger.

### Code — Stata

Convention reference: `.claude/rules/stata-code-conventions.md`.

## Verification ledger

A project-level cache so checks aren't re-run on unchanged artifacts.

**File:** `.claude/state/verification-ledger.md` — tracked in git so the cache is cross-session and cross-machine. Format: one row per `(path, check)`; sortable, greppable.

```markdown
| Path | Check | Verified At | File hash | Result | Evidence |
|------|-------|-------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| scripts/01_clean.do | no-hardcoded-paths | 2026-04-28T10:00Z | a1b2c3d4e5f6 | PASS | grep returned 0 matches |
| scripts/01_clean.do | seed-set-once | 2026-04-28T10:00Z | a1b2c3d4e5f6 | PASS | line 5: `set seed 20260428` |
| scripts/02_analysis.do | no-hardcoded-paths | 2026-04-28T10:05Z | f7e8d9c0b1a2 | FAIL | line 47: `use "/Users/foo/data.dta"` |
```

**Columns:**
- *Path* — repo-relative.
- *Check* — slug from the per-domain table above (e.g., `no-hardcoded-paths`, `seed-set-once`, `parallel-trends`).
- *Verified At* — ISO 8601, UTC, minute precision.
- *File hash* — `sha256(<path>) | head -c 12`. Hash the file content, not the metadata.
- *Result* — `PASS`, `FAIL`, or `ASSUMED`. `ASSUMED` is for documented exceptions (cost-prohibitive, unavailable infrastructure).
- *Evidence* — short string with the specific detail (line number, count, p-value). Long output goes in a session log; the ledger shows the headline.

**Lookup protocol — before running check `C` on path `P`:**
1. Compute `current_hash = sha256(P) | head -c 12`.
2. Read the ledger row for `(P, C)`.
3. If row exists AND `File hash` matches `current_hash` AND `Result == PASS`: cite the ledger entry; skip running the check.
4. If row exists AND `File hash` differs: stale → re-run, update the row in place.
5. If row doesn't exist: run, append a new row.
6. If row exists AND `Result == FAIL` AND file unchanged: still FAIL — flag as an unresolved violation. (Don't re-run; the agent or user must fix `P` first, then recheck explicitly.)

**Stale invalidation triggers — force re-run regardless of cached row:**
- The convention itself changed: if the relevant rule file (`stata-code-conventions.md`, etc.) was modified after the ledger row's `Verified At`, re-run.
- User invokes `/tools verify --force` (rebuilds ledger from scratch).
- Pre-submission gate: `verifier` in submission mode rebuilds the ledger paranoically.

**Cost analysis:** `sha256` of a typical script is microseconds; a `grep` over a project is milliseconds; ledger lookup is microseconds. First check on a new artifact pays the verification cost; subsequent checks on the unchanged artifact pay only lookup cost. Net effect: no bloat under normal editing.

**Audit:** the ledger is a living receipt.
- `grep '| FAIL |' .claude/state/verification-ledger.md` → all open violations.
- `grep '01_clean.do' .claude/state/verification-ledger.md` → verification history of one file.
- `grep '| ASSUMED |' .claude/state/verification-ledger.md` → all unverified-by-cost claims, useful before submission to revisit each.

---

## Exception protocol

When full verification isn't feasible (cost too high, infrastructure unavailable, only run on a remote cluster, etc.), the agent must explicitly state "Assumed compliant; not independently verified" — both in any associated session log and in the ledger row's `Result = ASSUMED` cell. The Evidence column then names the reason: `Cost-prohibitive: requires HPC re-run`. This makes the unverified claim auditable. It is *never* an option to imply compliance without evidence and without an `ASSUMED` ledger entry.

---

## Cross-references

This rule reinforces — does not replace — the following:

- `verification-protocol.md` — provides per-target end-of-task checklists. This rule changes the *stance* (assume defects) and adds the *cache* (ledger).
- `replication-protocol.md` — replication tolerance thresholds. This rule's "Replication" checklist is a per-row enforcement of those thresholds.
- `primary-source-first.md` — citation evidence. The bibliography checklist's "reading notes exist" check delegates to that rule's hooks.
- `agents.md` § Adversarial Pairing — worker-critic separation. This rule extends the same adversarial stance to workers evaluating artifacts (not just to critics evaluating workers).

---

## Critic enforcement

Critic agents (`coder-critic`, `writer-critic`, `verifier`, plus `strategist-critic` on applied-micro and `designer-critic` / `theorist-critic` on behavioral) all check whether the artifact under review has the relevant ledger rows in `PASS` state. Missing ledger rows in load-bearing paths trigger a deduction. See each critic agent for the specific deduction table.
