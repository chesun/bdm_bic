# CLAUDE.MD -- Behavioral & Experimental Economics Research with Claude Code

<!-- HOW TO USE: Replace [BRACKETED PLACEHOLDERS] with your project info.
     Customize Beamer environments for your talk preamble.
     Keep this file under ~150 lines — Claude loads it every session.
     Based on clo-author (Hugo Sant'Anna) + infrastructure from Pedro Sant'Anna
     + behavioral/experimental econ extensions. -->

**Project:** [YOUR PROJECT NAME]
**Institution:** [YOUR INSTITUTION]
**Field:** Behavioral & Experimental Economics
**Branch:** main
**Stata version:** 17
**LaTeX engine:** pdflatex
**Overleaf path:** [YOUR OVERLEAF PATH — e.g., ~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Apps/Overleaf/project-name]

## Core Principles

- **Plan first** -- enter plan mode before non-trivial tasks; save plans to `quality_reports/plans/`
- **Verify after** -- compile and confirm output at the end of every task
- **Single source of truth** -- Paper `main.tex` is authoritative; talks and supplements derive from it
- **Quality gates** -- weighted aggregate score; nothing ships below 80/100; see `quality.md`
- **Worker-critic pairs** -- every creator has a paired critic; critics never edit files
- **Inference first** -- design experiments with inference in mind from the start; tests and treatments co-evolve (see inference-first checklist)
- **Auto-memory** -- corrections and preferences are saved automatically via Claude Code's built-in memory system

## Getting Started

1. Fill in the `[BRACKETED PLACEHOLDERS]` in this file
2. Run `/discover interview [topic]` to build your research specification
3. Or run `/new-project [topic]` for the full orchestrated pipeline

## Folder Structure

The project spans two locations: a **git repo** (code, data, experiments, workflow) and an **Overleaf project** (paper, talks, LaTeX). Overleaf syncs via Dropbox.

## Quality Thresholds

| Score | Gate | Applies To |
|-------|------|------------|
| 80 | Commit | Weighted aggregate (blocking) |
| 90 | PR | Weighted aggregate (blocking) |
| 95 | Submission | Aggregate + all components >= 80 |
| -- | Advisory | Talks (reported, non-blocking) |

See `quality.md` for behavioral scoring weights (design 25%, paper 20%, theory 15%).
