# Changelog

All notable changes to this fork are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the version scheme follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), with the caveat that under `0.x.y` the rule/skill/agent contracts may shift between minor versions. Once at `1.0.0`, contracts will be stable per semver.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Comprehensive propagation infrastructure** — workflow-to-consumer feature propagation that handles parallel-history overlays correctly. Replaces error-prone manual cherry-picking with a class-aware, manifest-driven system. Design and rationale in `quality_reports/plans/2026-05-07_comprehensive-propagation-plan.md`.
  - **File-class manifest** at `.claude/file-classes.toml` (tracked on `main`, itself Class A so it propagates to overlays). Default for unlisted paths = Class A.
  - **Three-class taxonomy + Excluded.** Class A — Universal (byte-identical across branches, source = main). Class B — Overlay-customized (genuine per-branch content, source = consumer's overlay). Class C — Overlay-only (exists on a specific overlay). Class D — Excluded (project-state files like `quality_reports/`, `MEMORY.md`, `data/`).
  - **`/tools propagate`** rewritten with class-aware routing (`.claude/skills/tools/propagate.py`, 433 → ~580 LOC). For each file: looks up class, routes to `main` (Class A) or consumer's overlay (Class B/C). Per-file output annotates source branch + class letter. `workflow-sync.json` gains `class` and `source_branch` fields per file. `resolve_patterns` filtered to `git ls-files` so untracked working-tree artifacts (.pyc, machine-local settings) don't leak to consumers.
  - **`/tools sync-overlays`** — new skill (`.claude/skills/tools/sync_overlays.py`). Pulls Class A updates from `main` to `applied-micro` and `behavioral` overlay worktrees. Never touches Class B/C. Default-skip-divergent (preserves intentional out-of-band edits); `--force` to overwrite stale-of-main. Pre-flight only blocks on uncommitted Class A paths.
  - **Bootstrap audit** (one-shot `bootstrap_manifest.py`): classified 240 tracked paths across the three branches into 118 Universal / 11 Overlay-customized / 34 Overlay-only / 77 Excluded.
  - **Phase D bootstrap executed** 2026-05-10: tag `bootstrap-2026-05-10` (commit `c10e276`). Both overlay branches caught up; all 7 consumer repos populated via `propagate --force-initial`. Idempotency verified.
- **Stata skill migrated to workflow** — `.claude/skills/stata/SKILL.md` (+ `references/doc_lookup.md`) ported from `claude-config/skills/stata/` to the workflow repo where it propagates to research consumers. Research-context skills (Stata, R, Python, LaTeX) belong with the research workflow; universal skills (skill-creator, mcp-builder, pdf, docx) stay global.
- **Stata 17 invocation mandate** — `.claude/rules/stata-code-conventions.md` gains an "Invocation (local machine)" section requiring `stata17` and explicitly forbidding direct calls to `/Applications/Stata/StataMP.app/...` (which is Stata 14; both versions ship a binary named `StataMP`). Closes a class of bugs where Claude in BDD invoked Stata 14 by reading the Stata 14 path from the old global skill. The migrated skill drops the Stata 14 documentation entirely so the wrong path can't be copied verbatim.

- **Destructive-action guardrails** — two new hooks + one rule that codify the prose-level "executing actions with care" guidance into deterministic enforcement, motivated by a 2026-04-25 incident where `git filter-repo --invert-paths` silently rewrote a Dropbox-shared repo's working tree and the session falsely narrated "working tree unchanged" without verification.
  - `.claude/hooks/destructive-action-guard.py` (PreToolUse, matcher `Bash`) — three tiers of detection:
    - **Tier 1: always-blocked**, regardless of cwd: `git filter-repo`, `filter-branch`, `push --force/-f/+refspec/--force-with-lease`, `rebase` (non-resumption), `reset --hard`, `clean -f...`, `update-ref -d`.
    - **Tier 2: path-conditional** — `rm -r/-R/-rf/-fr` and `find ... -delete` blocked only when the target path resolves under a canonical macOS cloud-storage mount (`~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox*`, `GoogleDrive-*`, `OneDrive-*`, `Box-*`, `~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs`, legacy `~/Dropbox`). Realpath-aware: symlinks into shared storage are caught. Parses leading `cd X && Y` chains for effective-cwd resolution.
    - **Tier 3: settings.json write gate** — closes the gap where `protect-files.sh` (Edit|Write matcher only) cannot observe Bash file writes. Token-based detection via shlex; the 5 write shapes are stdout redirection, `tee`, `sed -i`, `mv`/`cp` overwrite, scripted writes (python/node/ruby/perl). Reads pass through; quoted argument bodies (commit messages) immune to false positives because shlex preserves them as opaque tokens.
  - `.claude/hooks/post-rewrite-verify.py` (PostToolUse, matcher `Bash`) — soft-injects an `ls`/`du` verification reminder into the next agent turn after history rewrites. Catches the false-success-narration mode that was the actual root cause of the 2026-04-25 incident.
  - `.claude/rules/destructive-actions.md` — full rule doc covering motivation, triggers, bypass mechanism, and the post-action verification protocol.
  - **Bypass:** `BYPASS_SHARED_GUARD=1` env-var prefix on the command. Audit-logged at `.claude/state/destructive-action-guard.log`.
  - **Tests:** 71 cases at `.claude/hooks/test_destructive_action_guard.py` covering all three tiers, bypass, symlink resolution, mount-point anchoring, resumption-form allowlist, and false-positive regression guards (commit messages, `.vscode/settings.json`).

### Fixed

- **`primary-source-first` hook all-caps filter** — added Filter 1a in `.claude/hooks/primary_source_lib.py` that rejects captured surnames where `len >= 3 and isupper()`. Eliminates false positives on status markers (`COMPLETED (2026)`, `DRAFT (2025)`, `DONE`, `BLOCKED`, `ACTIVE`, `TODO`, `FIXME`, `WIP`, `PENDING`) and acronym corporate authors (`BLS`, `OECD`, `USDA`, `IRS`, `CDC`). Real surnames in academic prose are never written ALL-CAPS; mixed-case surnames (`McGregor`, `DeAngelo`, `O'Brien`) still match. Rule doc updated in `primary-source-first.md` ("four filters" → "five filters"). +17 test assertions.
- **Markdown math-delimiter convention** — `~/.claude/rules/markdown-macdown-compat.md` made the rule explicit: use `$...$` for inline math and `$$...$$` for display math. MacDown's MathJax does not render `\(...\)` or `\[...\]`. The prior rule documented escape-for-currency but never said which delimiters to USE for math, so Claude defaulted to LaTeX-native forms which silently broke. Sibling `belief_distortion_discrimination/quality_reports/plans/2026-05-01_analysis-upgrade-memo.md` converted accordingly.

### Documented (not yet captured in v0.1.0 release notes; landed 2026-04-29)

- **Universal anti-AI-prose rule + `/humanize` skill** — `.claude/rules/anti-ai-prose.md` with ~35 patterns across 6 categories (lexical, syntactic, structural, rhetorical, content, communication), severity tiers, voice profiles (academic / slide / correspondence / blog / docs), escape comments. `/humanize` is the universal entry point that infers the voice profile from the file path and dispatches to the writer (paper/), storyteller (talks/), or generic-prose mode. Replaces the writer's per-paper humanizer pass. (Shipped post-CHANGELOG-finalize; included in the v0.1.0 release tag.)

## [v0.1.0] — 2026-04-28 (Preview)

First public release. The workflow has been tested internally on multiple research projects across applied micro and behavioral economics, and is now opened up for forking.

### Added

#### Four-rule epistemic stack
The workflow's "don't fabricate" guards. Each addresses a distinct failure mode of "filling in blanks":

- **`no-assumptions.md`** — don't guess about user-side facts (preferences, deadlines, target journal, infrastructure, role boundaries). Ask, leave out, or explicitly state the assumption with "Assuming X (let me know if otherwise)." Ported and expanded from the user's global `~/.claude/rules/no-assumptions.md` so public-release forks get it bundled.
- **`primary-source-first.md`** — don't make framing claims about external papers without reading them. Hook-enforced: PreToolUse blocks file edits citing un-read papers; Stop hook audits conversation prose for the same. Reading notes required at `master_supporting_docs/literature/reading_notes/`. Includes a citation-style convention (two-coauthor papers as "Author and Author (year)").
- **`derive-dont-guess.md`** — don't fabricate facts the repo encodes (filepaths, variable names, macros, output conventions, config values). Per-entity-type lookup table; cite source `file:line` for derived entities; "new convention" disclosure when no precedent exists. Triggered by an incident where Claude guessed dataset paths instead of reading `do/settings.do`.
- **`adversarial-default.md`** — don't claim compliance without evidence. Burden of proof is on the asserter. Verification results cache in `.claude/state/verification-ledger.md` (file-hash-keyed) so unchanged artifacts aren't re-checked. Six per-domain checklists (code: Stata/R/Python; data; design; identification; replication; bibliography). Triggered by an incident where Claude assumed inherited Stata code satisfied the no-hardcoded-paths convention.

#### Verification ledger
Markdown cache at `.claude/state/verification-ledger.md`. Each row: `path | check | verified_at | sha256[:12] | result | evidence`. Lookup protocol: file-hash match → cite cached PASS, no re-run. Stale invalidation triggers when convention rule modified or `/tools verify --force` invoked. Tracked in git for cross-session and cross-machine persistence.

#### Decision log (ADRs)
Substantive decisions live in `decisions/NNNN_slug.md`. Append-only; immutable once `Decided`; supersession via new ADRs. Referenced by number from session logs, plans, and other ADRs.

#### Replication protocol
5-phase protocol from inventory through AEA-deposit prep. Concrete tolerance thresholds (integers exact, point estimates < 0.01, SEs < 0.05, p-values same significance level, percentages < 0.1pp). Verifier in submission mode runs the full 6-check AEA audit against this protocol.

#### Code conventions
Per-language standards as standalone rules: `stata-code-conventions.md`, `r-code-conventions.md`, `python-code-conventions.md`. Cover hardcoded-path detection, seed discipline, package conventions, output formats, and language-specific pitfalls (e.g., TWFE diagnostics in R, `cap log close` discipline in Stata).

#### Single-source-of-truth rule
`single-source-of-truth.md` — paper is authoritative; talks and supplementary derive from it. SSOT chain documented; per-format slide counts (job market 40-50, seminar 25-35, short 10-15, lightning 3-5).

#### Working-paper-format rule
`working-paper-format.md` — economics-specific LaTeX preamble standards. `biblatex` + `biber` (not `natbib`); `lmodern`; `microtype`; UC Davis dissertation-friendly title page; deduction tables for the writer-critic.

#### Editor agent
Synthesizes referee reports into editorial decisions. Selects dispositions (Accept / Minor Revisions / Major Revisions / Reject) using journal-culture calibration from `.claude/references/journal-profiles.md`.

#### Specialized critics
- `tikz-reviewer` — devil's-advocate review of TikZ diagrams (label positioning, overlap, visual consistency).
- `methods-referee` and `domain-referee` — independent blind reviewers for peer-review simulation.

#### Hooks
- `primary-source-check` (PreToolUse) + `primary-source-audit` (Stop) — citation grounding.
- `log-reminder` (Stop) — hard-cap reminder every 10 responses.
- `verify-reminder` (PostToolUse) — prompts verification after edits.
- `context-monitor` (PostToolUse) — usage warnings at 40/55/65/80/90%; writes pre-compact-state.json snapshot at 90% as a fallback for [anthropics/claude-code#14111](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/14111) (PreCompact silently bypasses on auto-compact when MCP servers are present). Warning output uses stderr so it actually reaches the user; the heuristic is `MAX_TOOL_CALLS=500` (env-overridable via `CONTEXT_MONITOR_MAX_TOOL_CALLS`), tuned for Opus 4.7 1M context.
- `pre-compact` + `post-compact-restore` — state preservation across context compaction.
- `protect-files` (PreToolUse) — guards against accidental writes to `settings.json`.

#### Three-branch model with paradigm overlays
- `main` (universal) — paradigm-agnostic research template. 17 agents, 14 skills, 25 rules.
- `applied-micro` (overlay) — adds `strategist` + `strategist-critic` agents, `/strategize`, `/balance`, `/event-study` skills, `air-gapped-workflow.md` rule.
- `behavioral` (overlay) — adds `designer`, `theorist`, `otree-specialist`, `qualtrics-specialist` agents, `/design`, `/theory`, `/otree`, `/qualtrics`, `/preregister` skills, `experiment-design-principles.md` rule (13 design principles with academic attributions), `inference-first-checklist.md` reference (14-step checklist), `experiments/` and `theory/` folder trees.

#### Quality scoring
Weighted aggregate score across components: literature 10%, data 10%, strategy/design 25%, code 15%, paper 25%, polish 10%, replication 5%. Gate thresholds: 80 (commit), 90 (PR), 95 + every component ≥ 80 (submission). Per-target deduction matrices in `quality.md`.

#### Critic-write architecture + reviews/plans lifecycle
Reframes the "critics never create" rule as a source-vs-report distinction. *Source artifacts* (`paper/`, `talks/`, `scripts/`, `do/`, `decisions/`, `theory/`, `experiments/designs/`, `figures/`, `tables/`, `references.bib`, `data/cleaned/`) remain read-only for critics. *Report artifacts* (`quality_reports/reviews/`) are write-encouraged so every critic invocation produces an audit trail.

All 13 critic-style agents (10 universal: `coder-critic`, `writer-critic`, `librarian-critic`, `explorer-critic`, `storyteller-critic`, `tikz-reviewer`, `domain-referee`, `methods-referee`, `verifier`, `editor`; plus `strategist-critic` on applied-micro and `designer-critic`, `theorist-critic` on behavioral) gained `Write` permission and a canonical save path:

```
quality_reports/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD_<target>_<critic>_review.md
```

Required header per review: `Date`, `Reviewer`, `Target`, `Score`, `Status: Active`, optional `Supersedes:`. Status values: `Active | Completed | Superseded by <path> | Archived`.

Lifecycle protocol prevents indefinite top-level growth in `quality_reports/reviews/` and `quality_reports/plans/`:

- **Supersession**: new review of the same target marks the prior `Status: Superseded by <new>`, `git mv` it to `archive/`, set `Supersedes:` in the new report, update `INDEX.md`.
- **Time-based archive**: `Status: Completed` + 90 days idle → move to `archive/`.
- **`INDEX.md` per folder**: lists `Active` items; critics consult before writing to avoid parallel duplicates.

Conventions documented in `quality_reports/reviews/README.md` and `quality_reports/plans/README.md`. Rule encoded in `.claude/rules/agents.md` § 2 + § 2a. Concepts page updated at `docs/concepts/worker-critic-pairs.md`.

#### Public documentation site
`docs/` ships with v0.1.0 as the long-form companion to `README.md`. 24 pages organized by audience:

- `docs/getting-started/` (7 pages) — prerequisites, installation, branch model, first-session walkthrough, plus portable applied-micro and behavioral overlay previews readable from any branch.
- `docs/concepts/` (7 pages) — appropriate-use ("capable-RA" analogy), epistemic-rules deep-dive, verification-ledger, worker-critic pairs, quality scoring, file-by-file upstream-differences diff vs `pedrohcgs/claude-code-my-workflow` and `hugosantanna/clo-author`.
- `docs/reference/` (6 pages) — catalogues of skills, agents, rules, hooks; glossary.
- `docs/customization/` (2 pages) — adapting `CLAUDE.md`, extending rules.
- `docs/faq.md`, `docs/contributing.md` — top-level lookup utilities.

### Acknowledgements

This fork descends from [`pedrohcgs/claude-code-my-workflow`](https://github.com/pedrohcgs/claude-code-my-workflow) (original lecture/slide template by Pedro Sant'Anna) and [`hugosantanna/clo-author`](https://github.com/hugosantanna/clo-author) (academic-writing adaptation by Hugo Sant'Anna). The research-paper re-target, the four-rule epistemic stack, the verification ledger, the three-branch overlay model, the quality scoring system, and the domain-specific tooling are added in this fork.

## [v0.1.1] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- **`NEVER_SURNAMES` blocklist expanded** with common book/series-title nouns (`methodology`, `handbook`, `encyclopedia`, `review`, `annual`, `bulletin`, `journal`, `volume`, `issue`, plus plurals). These were previously parsed as surnames when adjacent to a year (e.g., "Handbook of Experimental Methodology 2025" → false-positive citation `methodology_2025`). Same blocklist mechanism that catches seasons, months, and document-structure words. Updated regression tests in `.claude/hooks/test_primary_source_lib.py` cover all 9 added words.

## [Unreleased] — Planned for v0.1.2

- **Auto-archive sweep skill.** A `/tools archive-stale` subcommand to sweep `Status: Completed` reviews/plans older than 90 days into `archive/`. Currently the lifecycle rule documents the protocol but moves are manual.
